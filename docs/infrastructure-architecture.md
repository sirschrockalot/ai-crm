# 🏗️ Infrastructure Architecture - Presidential Digs CRM

## 📋 Executive Summary

This document defines the comprehensive infrastructure architecture for the Presidential Digs CRM platform, designed to support a multi-tenant, microservices-based CRM system for real estate wholesaling operations. The architecture leverages Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with a focus on security, scalability, and operational excellence.

### **Key Architecture Decisions:**
- **Cloud Provider:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP) with multi-region setup
- **Container Platform:** Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) with auto-scaling
- **Database:** MongoDB Atlas with multi-region replication
- **CI/CD:** GitOps with ArgoCD and GitHub Actions
- **Security:** Defense-in-depth with private VPC and network policies
- **Monitoring:** Comprehensive observability with Prometheus, Grafana, and Cloud Monitoring

---

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Overview

### **Infrastructure Strategy**

- **Cloud Provider:** AWS (primary), with multi-cloud capability for critical services
- **Core Services:** EKS for container orchestration, RDS for databases, S3 for storage, CloudFront for CDN
- **Regional Architecture:** Multi-region active-passive with primary in us-east-1, DR in us-west-2
- **Multi-environment Strategy:** Development, Staging, UAT, Production with identical infrastructure patterns

### **Detailed Rationale:**

**Cloud Provider Choice (GCP):**
- **Trade-offs:** GCP provides comprehensive managed services for our multi-tenant, microservices architecture
- **Assumptions:** Team has GCP expertise and budget allows for enterprise-grade cloud services
- **Key Decisions:** Chose GCP over AWS/Azure due to better container orchestration (GKE) and database services for our MongoDB requirements

**Multi-Region Strategy:**
- **Trade-offs:** Active-passive vs active-active - chose active-passive for cost efficiency while maintaining RTO/RPO requirements
- **Assumptions:** Primary user base in US Central, with growth potential in US East
- **Key Decisions:** us-central1 as primary region for latency optimization, us-east1 as DR for geographic separation

**Environment Strategy:**
- **Trade-offs:** Identical infrastructure patterns vs environment-specific optimization - chose identical for consistency and easier promotion
- **Assumptions:** Development team needs production-like environments for accurate testing
- **Key Decisions:** Four environments (dev, staging, UAT, prod) with automated promotion pipeline

---

## 🔧 Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

### **IaC Approach**

- **Tools & Frameworks:** Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, Helm for Kubernetes manifests, Docker Compose for local development
- **Repository Structure:** Monorepo with infrastructure code alongside application code, separate Terraform workspaces per environment
- **State Management:** Terraform Cloud for remote state management with workspace isolation and state locking
- **Dependency Management:** Terraform modules for reusable infrastructure components, Helm charts for application deployment

### **Critical Rule Implementation:**
- **All infrastructure must be defined as code** - No manual resource creation in production environments
- **Version control for all infrastructure changes** - All changes go through pull request process
- **Automated infrastructure testing** - Terraform plan validation in CI/CD pipeline

---

## 🌍 Environment Configuration

### **Environment Strategy**

- **Environment Promotion Strategy:** Automated promotion pipeline with manual approval gates for production
- **Configuration Management:** Environment-specific configuration files with secrets management via GitHub Secrets
- **Secret Management:** GitHub Secrets for CI/CD, Google Secret Manager for runtime secrets
- **Feature Flag Integration:** LaunchDarkly integration for feature management across environments

### **Environment Details:**

#### **Development Environment**
- **Purpose:** Daily development and feature testing
- **Resources:** Shared GKE cluster with resource limits, development database instance
- **Access Control:** Full developer access, no production data
- **Data Classification:** Synthetic test data only

#### **Staging Environment**
- **Purpose:** Integration testing and pre-production validation
- **Resources:** Production-like infrastructure with reduced capacity
- **Access Control:** Developer and QA team access, limited admin access
- **Data Classification:** Anonymized production data for realistic testing

#### **UAT Environment**
- **Purpose:** User acceptance testing and stakeholder validation
- **Resources:** Production-equivalent infrastructure
- **Access Control:** Stakeholder access, read-only for most users
- **Data Classification:** Anonymized production data with realistic scenarios

#### **Production Environment**
- **Purpose:** Live application serving real users
- **Resources:** Full production infrastructure with auto-scaling
- **Access Control:** Restricted access, role-based permissions
- **Data Classification:** Real production data with full security controls

---

## 🔄 Environment Transition Strategy

### **Complete Lifecycle Management**

- **Development to Production Pipeline:** GitOps-based promotion with automated testing gates
- **Deployment Stages and Gates:** Development → Staging → UAT → Production with quality gates
- **Approval Workflows and Authorities:** Automated promotion to staging, manual approval for production
- **Rollback Procedures:** Automated rollback triggers with manual override capabilities
- **Change Cadence and Release Windows:** Weekly releases with emergency hotfix procedures
- **Environment-Specific Configuration Management:** Helm values and Terraform variables per environment

## 🌐 Network Architecture

### **Network Topology Design**

- **VPC/VNET Design:** Multi-tier VPC with public, private, and database subnets
- **Subnet Strategy:** Regional subnets with CIDR planning for scalability
- **Security Groups & NACLs:** Defense-in-depth with network and application-level security
- **Load Balancers & API Gateways:** Google Cloud Load Balancer with Cloud Armor protection
- **Service Mesh:** Istio service mesh for microservices communication and security
