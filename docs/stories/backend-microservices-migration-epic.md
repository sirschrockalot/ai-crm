# Backend Microservices Migration - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

Break out the monolithic backend into individual microservices that can start, stop, and scale independently within their own Docker containers, improving troubleshooting capabilities and enabling load-based scaling.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- Current relevant functionality: Monolithic NestJS backend with multiple modules (auth, users, leads, buyers, analytics, etc.)
- Technology stack: NestJS, MongoDB Atlas, Docker, Kubernetes deployment
- Integration points: Frontend API calls, database connections, inter-module communication, external service integrations

**Enhancement Details:**

- What's being added/changed: Refactor monolithic backend into individual microservices with Docker containerization
- How it integrates: Maintain existing API contracts while enabling independent service deployment and scaling
- Success criteria: Each service can run independently, scale based on load, and be troubleshooted in isolation

## Stories

List 1-3 focused stories that complete the epic:

1. **Story 1:** Extract Authentication Service - Create standalone auth microservice with Docker containerization
2. **Story 2:** Extract Core Business Services - Break out leads, buyers, and user management into individual microservices
3. **Story 3:** Implement Service Discovery & Load Balancing - Add service mesh capabilities for inter-service communication

## Compatibility Requirements

- [ ] Existing APIs remain unchanged
- [ ] Database schema changes are backward compatible
- [ ] Frontend integration points maintain current behavior
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal during transition

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Breaking existing functionality during service extraction
- **Mitigation:** Incremental extraction with comprehensive testing at each step
- **Rollback Plan:** Maintain ability to revert to monolithic deployment if critical issues arise

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing
- [ ] Integration points working correctly
- [ ] Documentation updated appropriately
- [ ] No regression in existing features
- [ ] Each service can be deployed independently
- [ ] Load-based scaling is functional
- [ ] Troubleshooting capabilities are improved

## Technical Considerations

- **Service Boundaries:** Identify clear domain boundaries for each microservice
- **Data Consistency:** Maintain data consistency across services during transition
- **API Gateway:** Implement or enhance API gateway for service routing
- **Monitoring:** Add service-level monitoring and health checks
- **Database Strategy:** Consider database per service vs. shared database approach

## Dependencies

- Docker and Kubernetes infrastructure must support multi-container deployments
- Service mesh or API gateway solution for inter-service communication
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure for distributed services
- CI/CD pipeline updates for multi-service deployment

## Success Metrics

- Reduced time to troubleshoot individual service issues
- Ability to scale services independently based on load
- Maintained or improved API response times
- Successful deployment of each service in isolation
