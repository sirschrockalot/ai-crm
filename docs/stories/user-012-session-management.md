---

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Implementation
- Create session tracking system with Redis/database storage
- Implement session management API endpoints
- Add configurable session timeouts per role
- Create concurrent session limiting middleware
- Implement security event detection algorithms
- Add comprehensive session logging
- Create session cleanup and maintenance jobs

### Database Changes
- Add `user_sessions` table with fields:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `user_id` (UUID, foreign key to users)
  - `session_token` (string, hashed)
  - `ip_address` (string)
  - `user_agent` (text)
  - `device_info` (JSONB)
  - `location` (string, derived from IP)
  - `created_at` (timestamp)
  - `last_activity` (timestamp)
  - `expires_at` (timestamp)
  - `is_active` (boolean)
  - `terminated_by` (UUID, foreign key to users, nullable)
  - `terminated_at` (timestamp, nullable)
  - `termination_reason` (string, nullable)

### Security Features
- Real-time suspicious activity detection
- IP-based session tracking
- Device fingerprinting
- Geographic location tracking
- Session anomaly detection

## Technical Notes

### Integration Points
- **Existing User Module**: Integrates with user management (USER-001)
- **Authentication System**: Uses existing auth tokens and validation
- **Activity Logging**: Integrates with existing logging system (USER-006)
- **Security Monitoring**: Integrates with existing security infrastructure

### Session Configuration

#### Default Session Timeouts
```json
{
  "admin": {
    "timeout": "8 hours",
    "maxConcurrent": 3,
    "idleTimeout": "2 hours"
  },
  "user": {
    "timeout": "24 hours",
    "maxConcurrent": 2,
    "idleTimeout": "4 hours"
  },
  "guest": {
    "timeout": "1 hour",
    "maxConcurrent": 1,
    "idleTimeout": "30 minutes"
  }
}
```

### Suspicious Activity Detection
- Multiple failed login attempts
- Login from unusual locations
- Login from multiple devices simultaneously
- Unusual session patterns
- Rapid session creation/deletion

### Security Considerations
- Session tokens must be cryptographically secure
- Session data should be encrypted at rest
- Session termination should be immediate
- All session activities must be logged
- Session cleanup should be automated

### Performance Considerations
- Session queries should be optimized with proper indexes
- Session monitoring should be asynchronous
- Session cleanup should be batched
- Session data should be cached for quick access

---

## Risk Assessment

### Primary Risks
- **Session Hijacking**: Mitigation - Secure token generation and validation
- **Performance Impact**: Mitigation - Optimize queries and use caching
- **False Positives**: Mitigation - Tune detection algorithms
- **Data Privacy**: Mitigation - Encrypt sensitive session data

### Rollback Plan
- Disable session management if critical issues arise
- Revert database migration if needed
- Maintain basic session functionality as fallback

---

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- USER-001: User management module (for user context)
- USER-006: User activity logging (for audit trail)
- Authentication system with token validation
- Redis or database for session storage

### Blocking
- None - can be developed in parallel with other stories

## Estimation

- **Story Points**: 3
- **Estimated Hours**: 12-16 hours
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Risk Level**: Medium
