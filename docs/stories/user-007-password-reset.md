## User Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** to reset my password when I forget it  
**So that** I can regain access to my account securely.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Users can request password reset via email
- [ ] Password reset tokens are securely generated and time-limited (24 hours)
- [ ] Users can set new passwords through secure reset flow
- [ ] Password reset attempts are rate-limited (max 3 requests per hour per email)
- [ ] Password reset events are logged for security audit
- [ ] Reset tokens are invalidated after use or expiration
- [ ] Users receive confirmation emails for successful password changes

### Security Requirements
- [ ] Reset tokens use cryptographically secure random generation
- [ ] Reset links are single-use only
- [ ] Password validation follows security standards (minimum 8 characters, complexity)
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- [ ] All password reset activities are logged with IP addresses

### User Experience Requirements
- [ ] Clear error messages for invalid/expired tokens
- [ ] Success confirmation when password is changed
- [ ] Email notifications are sent promptly
- [ ] Reset flow is intuitive and accessible

---

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Implementation
- Create password reset request endpoint (`POST /auth/forgot-password`)
- Create password reset validation endpoint (`POST /auth/reset-password`)
- Implement secure token generation using `crypto.randomBytes(32)`
- Add password reset token data model with expiration
- Integrate with existing email service for notifications
- Implement rate limiting middleware for reset requests
- Add comprehensive logging for security events

### Database Changes
- Add `password_reset_tokens` table with fields:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `user_id` (UUID, foreign key to users)
  - `token` (string, hashed)
  - `expires_at` (timestamp)
  - `used_at` (timestamp, nullable)
  - `created_at` (timestamp)
  - `ip_address` (string)

### Email Templates
- Password reset request email with secure link
- Password change confirmation email
- Rate limit exceeded notification

- [ ] Email notifications are sent successfully

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] All unit tests pass (>90% coverage)
- [ ] All integration tests pass
- [ ] Security testing completed and passed
- [ ] Performance testing shows acceptable response times
- [ ] Code review completed and approved

### Documentation Requirements
- [ ] API documentation updated with new endpoints
- [ ] Security documentation updated
- [ ] User guide updated with password reset instructions
- [ ] Admin guide updated with monitoring information

### Deployment Requirements
- [ ] Database migration tested in staging
- [ ] Email templates configured in production
- [ ] Rate limiting configured appropriately
- [ ] Monitoring alerts configured for security events

## Technical Notes

### Integration Points
- **Existing User Module**: Integrates with user authentication and validation
- **Email Service**: Uses existing email notification infrastructure
- **Logging System**: Integrates with existing activity logging (USER-006)
- **Rate Limiting**: Uses existing rate limiting middleware

### Security Considerations
- Tokens must be cryptographically secure (32 bytes minimum)
- All tokens should be hashed before storage
- Rate limiting should be IP-based to prevent abuse
- Logging should include IP addresses and user agents
- Password validation should follow OWASP guidelines

### Performance Considerations
- Token generation should be asynchronous
- Email sending should be queued to prevent blocking
- Database queries should be optimized with proper indexes
- Rate limiting should use efficient caching

---

## Risk Assessment

### Primary Risks
- **Email Delivery Issues**: Mitigation - Use reliable email service with retry logic
- **Token Security**: Mitigation - Use cryptographically secure generation and proper hashing
- **Rate Limiting Bypass**: Mitigation - Implement multiple layers of rate limiting

### Rollback Plan
- Disable password reset endpoints if critical issues arise
- Revert database migration if needed
- Maintain existing password change functionality as fallback

---

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- USER-001: User management module (for user validation)
- USER-006: User activity logging (for security audit)
- Email service infrastructure
- Rate limiting middleware

### Blocking
- None - can be developed in parallel with other stories

---

## Estimation

- **Story Points**: 3
- **Estimated Hours**: 12-16 hours
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Risk Level**: Medium
