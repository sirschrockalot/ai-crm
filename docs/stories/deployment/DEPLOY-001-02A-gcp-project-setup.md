## Title
Create and configure GCP project

## User Story
As a DevOps engineer, I want to create a dedicated Google Cloud project so that all CRM infrastructure costs and resources are properly organized and managed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] New GCP project is created with appropriate naming convention
- [ ] Project metadata and labels are configured
- [ ] Project settings are optimized for CRM deployment
- [ ] Project is accessible to authorized team members
- [ ] Project follows GCP best practices and naming conventions

## Technical Details
- **Project Name**: `presidential-digs-crm-{env}` (e.g., presidential-digs-crm-dev)
- **Organization**: Parent organization or standalone project
- **Region**: Primary region for resource deployment
- **Labels**: Environment, team, application, cost center
- **Access**: Team member access with appropriate roles

## Implementation Steps
1. **Create new GCP project**
   - Use `gcloud projects create` or Terraform
   - Set project ID following naming convention
   - Configure project display name
   - Set project number for reference

2. **Configure project metadata**
   - Set project description
   - Configure project labels:
     - `environment`: dev/staging/prod
     - `team`: devops/engineering
     - `application`: crm
     - `cost-center`: presidential-digs
   - Set project organization (if applicable)

3. **Configure project settings**
   - Enable required APIs (compute, networking, storage)
   - Set default compute region and zone
   - Configure project quotas and limits
   - Set up project-level policies

4. **Set up team access**
   - Grant appropriate IAM roles to team members
   - Set up service account access
   - Configure project-level permissions
   - Test access for all team members

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Project is created and accessible
- [ ] All required APIs are enabled
- [ ] Project metadata and labels are configured
- [ ] Team access is properly configured
- [ ] Project settings are optimized
- [ ] Documentation is updated

## Dependencies
- DEPLOY-001-01B: Configure Google Cloud provider and authentication

## Estimate
**0.5 days**

## Risk Level
**Low** - Standard GCP project creation

## Best Practices
- Use consistent naming convention across all environments
- Enable only required APIs to minimize attack surface
- Apply appropriate labels for cost tracking and organization
- Use least privilege principle for team access
- Document project configuration for team reference

## Notes
- Consider using Terraform for project creation to maintain consistency
- Plan for project organization structure if multiple projects are needed
- Ensure project naming follows GCP requirements and conventions
- Set up project-level monitoring and alerting early
- Consider using project factory patterns for multiple environments
