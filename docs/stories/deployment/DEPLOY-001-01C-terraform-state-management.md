## Title
Set up Terraform state management

## User Story
As a DevOps engineer, I want to configure remote state storage in Google Cloud Storage so that Terraform state is securely stored, versioned, and accessible to the team.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Google Cloud Storage backend is configured for Terraform state
- [ ] State locking is implemented to prevent concurrent modifications
- [ ] State encryption is enabled for security
- [ ] State can be accessed by authorized team members
- [ ] State management follows Terraform best practices

## Technical Details
- **Backend**: Google Cloud Storage
- **State Locking**: Cloud Storage object versioning
- **Encryption**: Customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK)
- **Access Control**: IAM policies for state bucket
- **Versioning**: Object versioning enabled for state history

## Implementation Steps
1. **Create Google Cloud Storage bucket for state**
   - Create bucket: `presidential-digs-crm-terraform-state`
   - Enable object versioning for state history
   - Configure bucket location and storage class
   - Set up lifecycle policies for cost optimization

2. **Configure state encryption and security**
   - Enable customer-managed encryption keys
   - Set up IAM policies for state bucket access
   - Configure bucket permissions for Terraform service account
   - Enable uniform bucket-level access

3. **Configure Terraform backend**
   - Update `backend.tf` with GCS backend configuration
   - Configure state file naming convention
   - Set up state locking configuration
   - Test backend configuration

4. **Test state management functionality**
   - Initialize Terraform with new backend
   - Test state locking with concurrent operations
   - Verify state encryption is working
   - Test state backup and recovery

## Definition of Done
- [ ] GCS bucket is created and properly configured
- [ ] State encryption is enabled and working
- [ ] State locking is functional
- [ ] Terraform backend is configured and tested
- [ ] Team access to state is properly configured
- [ ] Documentation is updated with state management details

## Dependencies
- DEPLOY-001-01A: Create Terraform project structure and basic configuration
- DEPLOY-001-01B: Configure Google Cloud provider and authentication
- DEPLOY-001-02A: Create and configure GCP project

## Estimate
**0.5 days**

## Risk Level
**Medium** - Critical for infrastructure management, involves security configuration

## Security Considerations
- Use customer-managed encryption keys for state encryption
- Implement least privilege access to state bucket
- Enable audit logging for state access
- Regular review of state bucket permissions
- Consider using separate state buckets per environment

## Notes
- State bucket naming should follow GCP naming conventions
- Consider implementing state backup strategies
- Document state management procedures for team reference
- Plan for state migration if needed in the future
- Test state locking with team collaboration scenarios
