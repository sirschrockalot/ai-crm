## Title
Create Terraform project structure and basic configuration

## User Story
As a DevOps engineer, I want to establish a well-organized Terraform project structure so that infrastructure code is maintainable, scalable, and follows best practices.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Directory structure is created with clear separation of concerns
- [ ] Terraform version and provider requirements are defined
- [ ] Basic .gitignore and README files are created
- [ ] Project follows Terraform best practices and conventions
- [ ] Directory structure supports multiple environments (dev, staging, prod)

## Technical Details
- **Tools**: Terraform CLI, Git
- **Structure**: Modular approach with environment separation
- **Version**: Terraform >= 1.0
- **Providers**: Google Cloud Provider
- **Environments**: Development, Staging, Production

## Implementation Steps
1. **Create root directory structure**
   ```
   terraform/
   ├── environments/
   │   ├── development/
   │   ├── staging/
   │   └── production/
   ├── modules/
   │   ├── network/
   │   ├── compute/
   │   ├── storage/
   │   └── iam/
   ├── scripts/
   ├── docs/
   └── examples/
   ```

2. **Create Terraform configuration files**
   - `versions.tf` - Terraform and provider versions
   - `providers.tf` - Provider configurations
   - `variables.tf` - Common variables
   - `outputs.tf` - Common outputs

3. **Set up environment-specific configurations**
   - Create `main.tf`, `variables.tf`, `terraform.tfvars` for each environment
   - Set up environment-specific variable values

4. **Create documentation and scripts**
   - README.md with project overview
   - .gitignore for Terraform files
   - Helper scripts for common operations

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All directories are created and organized
- [ ] Terraform configuration files are in place
- [ ] .gitignore excludes appropriate files
- [ ] README.md documents the project structure
- [ ] Project can be initialized with `terraform init`
- [ ] Code review is completed

## Dependencies
- None (this is a foundational task)

## Estimate
**1 day**

## Risk Level
**Low** - Standard Terraform setup with no external dependencies

## Notes
- Follow HashiCorp's recommended Terraform project structure
- Ensure the structure supports future scaling and additional modules
- Consider using Terraform workspaces for environment separation
- Document any deviations from standard practices
