# Extract Core Business Services - User Story

## Story Title
Extract Core Business Services - Brownfield Addition

## User Story
As a **Developer/DevOps Engineer**,
I want **leads, buyers, and user management services to run independently in separate Docker containers**,
So that **I can scale business logic services based on demand and troubleshoot them in isolation**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Existing leads, buyers, and users modules in NestJS backend, frontend dashboard components, analytics module
- Technology: NestJS, MongoDB Atlas, Docker, Kubernetes, existing business logic patterns
- Follows pattern: Module-based architecture with shared database connections
- Touch points: CRUD operations for leads/buyers/users, dashboard data aggregation, user analytics

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Leads service runs as standalone microservice in separate Docker container
2. Buyers service runs as standalone microservice in separate Docker container
3. User management service runs as standalone microservice in separate Docker container
4. All existing CRUD operations continue to work unchanged
5. Dashboard data aggregation maintains current functionality

**Integration Requirements:**
6. Existing frontend dashboard and forms continue to work unchanged
7. New services follow existing Docker containerization pattern
8. Integration with analytics and reporting systems maintains current behavior
9. Database connections and transactions remain consistent

**Quality Requirements:**
10. Changes are covered by comprehensive service tests
11. Docker configurations are documented and tested
12. No regression in existing business functionality verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Extract business modules into separate services while maintaining existing API contracts and database connections
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow current Docker containerization, Kubernetes deployment, and database connection patterns
- **Key Constraints:** Must maintain data consistency and backward compatibility with existing frontend and analytics

## Definition of Done

- [x] All three business services run independently in separate Docker containers
- [x] All existing CRUD operations function identically
- [x] Frontend dashboard and forms work without changes
- [x] Data aggregation and analytics continue to function
- [x] Comprehensive tests cover all business service functionality
- [x] Docker configurations are documented and tested
- [x] Kubernetes deployment configurations are updated
- [x] No regression in existing business functionality

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** Breaking data consistency or existing business logic during extraction
- **Mitigation:** Incremental extraction with comprehensive testing, maintain shared database initially
- **Rollback:** Maintain ability to revert to monolithic business modules if needed

**Compatibility Verification:**
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing business APIs
- ✅ Database operations maintain current behavior and consistency
- ✅ Frontend integration remains unchanged
- ✅ Performance impact is negligible

## Implementation Steps

1. ✅ **Extract Leads Service** (2-3 hours) - **COMPLETED**
   - ✅ Copy leads module to separate service directory
   - ✅ Update imports and dependencies
   - ✅ Ensure all leads functionality is self-contained
   - ✅ Test CRUD operations independently

2. ✅ **Extract Buyers Service** (2-3 hours) - **COMPLETED**
   - ✅ Copy buyers module to separate service directory
   - ✅ Update imports and dependencies
   - ✅ Ensure all buyers functionality is self-contained
   - ✅ Test CRUD operations independently

3. ✅ **Extract User Management Service** (2-3 hours) - **COMPLETED**
   - ✅ Copy users module to separate service directory
   - ✅ Update imports and dependencies
   - ✅ Ensure all user management functionality is self-contained
   - ✅ Test CRUD operations independently

4. ✅ **Docker Configuration** (2-3 hours) - **COMPLETED**
   - ✅ Create Dockerfiles for all three services
   - ✅ Configure environment variables and ports
   - ✅ Test container builds and runs

5. ✅ **Integration Testing** (3-4 hours) - **COMPLETED**
   - ✅ Verify all CRUD operations work identically
   - ✅ Test frontend dashboard and forms
   - ✅ Validate data aggregation and analytics
   - ✅ Performance testing to ensure no degradation

6. ✅ **Deployment Configuration** (2-3 hours) - **COMPLETED**
   - ✅ Update Kubernetes deployments for all services
   - ✅ Configure service discovery and networking
   - ✅ Test deployment and rollback procedures

**Total Estimated Time: 13-19 hours**

## Implementation Summary

✅ **COMPLETED** - All three business services have been successfully extracted and are running independently:

### Services Created:
1. **Leads Service** (`src/leads-service/`) - Port 3002
2. **Buyers Service** (`src/buyers-service/`) - Port 3003  
3. **Users Service** (`src/users-service/`) - Port 3004

### Key Features Implemented:
- ✅ Independent Docker containers for each service
- ✅ Shared MongoDB database for data consistency
- ✅ Health check endpoints for monitoring
- ✅ Swagger API documentation
- ✅ Comprehensive Docker configurations
- ✅ Development and production deployment support
- ✅ Security middleware (CORS, rate limiting, helmet)
- ✅ Comprehensive testing scripts

### Files Created:
- `docker-compose.business-services.yml` - Combined deployment
- `docs/business-services-implementation.md` - Documentation
- `scripts/test-business-services.sh` - Testing script
- Individual service configurations and Dockerfiles

### Deployment:
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.business-services.yml up -d

# Test services
./scripts/test-business-services.sh
```

## Success Criteria

- ✅ All three business services run independently without affecting other services
- ✅ All existing business functionality works identically
- ✅ Services can be deployed, scaled, and troubleshooted independently
- ✅ Data consistency is maintained across all services
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing system

## Dependencies

- ✅ Authentication service extraction must be completed first
- ✅ Shared database strategy must be established
- ✅ Service-to-service communication patterns must be defined
