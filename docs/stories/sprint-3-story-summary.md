## Sprint 3 Execution Plan

### Sprint Goal
Establish the critical foundation for frontend architecture migration by creating a unified Next.js application structure with shared components and deployment pipeline.

### Sprint Duration
2 weeks (10 working days)

### Team Capacity
- 2 Frontend Developers
- 1 DevOps Engineer
- 1 QA Engineer

### Sprint Backlog Priority Order

1. **Story 1.1: Setup Monolithic Application Structure** (Critical)
   - Must be completed first as it's the foundation for all other work
   - Establishes the basic application structure and configuration

2. **Story 1.2: Establish Shared Component Library** (High)
   - Depends on Story 1.1
   - Creates reusable components that will be used throughout the application

3. **Story 1.3: Configure Build and Deployment Pipeline** (High)
   - Depends on Stories 1.1 and 1.2
   - Ensures the application can be built and deployed successfully

### Definition of Ready
Each story is ready for development when:
- âœ… Story file is created with comprehensive requirements
- âœ… Acceptance criteria are clearly defined
- âœ… Technical specifications are documented
- âœ… Dependencies are identified
- âœ… Testing requirements are specified
- âœ… File structure and locations are defined

### Definition of Done
Each story is complete when:
- âœ… All acceptance criteria are met
- âœ… All tasks and subtasks are completed
- âœ… Code is written and tested
- âœ… Documentation is updated
- âœ… Code review is completed
- âœ… QA testing is passed
- âœ… Story is deployed to staging environment

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Story 1.1 Dependencies:** If the foundation structure is not properly established, all subsequent stories will be affected
- **Technical Complexity:** Migrating from micro-apps to monolithic requires careful planning and execution

### Medium Risk
- **Component Library Integration:** Ensuring all components work together seamlessly
- **Build Pipeline Configuration:** Setting up optimal build and deployment processes

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with Story 1.1 and ensure it's thoroughly tested before proceeding
- Use incremental development and testing approach
- Maintain backward compatibility during migration
- Regular code reviews and testing throughout the sprint

## Success Criteria

### Sprint Success Metrics
- âœ… All 3 stories in Sprint 3 are completed
- âœ… Monolithic application structure is established
- âœ… Shared component library is functional
- âœ… Build and deployment pipeline is operational
- âœ… Application can be built and deployed successfully
- âœ… All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline

### Quality Metrics
- âœ… Code coverage > 80% for all new code
- âœ… No critical bugs in staging environment
- âœ… Performance meets established benchmarks
- âœ… Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- âœ… Responsive design works on all target devices

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Development Team:** Begin implementation of Story 1.1
2. **Scrum Master:** Monitor progress and facilitate daily standups
3. **Product Owner:** Review completed stories and provide feedback
4. **QA Team:** Prepare test cases and begin testing as stories are completed

### Future Sprints
- **Sprint 4:** Epic 2 - Lead Management Feature Migration
- **Sprint 5:** Epic 3 - Automation Feature Migration
- **Sprint 6:** Epic 4 - Dashboard and Analytics Integration
- **Sprint 7:** Epic 5 - Testing and Quality Assurance
- **Sprint 8:** Epic 6 - Performance Optimization and Final Integration

## Conclusion

Sprint 3 is well-prepared with comprehensive story documentation that provides clear guidance for the development team. The stories are properly sequenced with dependencies identified, and all technical requirements are documented. The sprint focuses on establishing the critical foundation that all subsequent migration work will depend on.
