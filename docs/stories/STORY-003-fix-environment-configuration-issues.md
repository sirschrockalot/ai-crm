# Story: Fix Environment Configuration Issues

## Story ID
`STORY-003`

## Epic
[EPIC-002: Fix Remaining Runtime Errors](../epics/fix-remaining-runtime-errors.md)

## Type
**Bug Fix**

## Priority
**High**

## Story Points
**2**

## Description
Investigate and fix environment configuration issues that may be contributing to runtime errors, including missing environment files, incorrect variable loading, and configuration validation problems.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] All required environment variables are properly loaded
- [x] Environment configuration is validated at startup
- [x] Clear error messages for missing/invalid configuration
- [x] Environment files are properly structured and documented
- [x] Configuration loading is consistent across environments

## Technical Requirements
- Environment variable validation
- Configuration schema definition
- Environment file templates
- Configuration loading error handling
- Environment-specific validation rules

## Implementation Details
1. **Environment Validation**
   - Implement configuration schema validation
   - Add required field checking
   - Implement type validation for critical variables
   - Add environment-specific validation rules

2. **Configuration Loading**
   - Enhance environment file loading
   - Add fallback configuration values
   - Implement configuration merging strategies
   - Add configuration loading error handling

3. **Documentation and Templates**
   - Create environment file templates
   - Document all required variables
   - Add configuration examples
   - Create setup guides for different environments

## Dependencies
- Environment configuration files
- Configuration management system
- Validation libraries

## Definition of Done
- [x] Environment configuration is properly validated
- [x] All required variables are documented
- [x] Configuration templates are created
- [x] Tests cover configuration scenarios
- [x] Documentation updated

## Testing
- [x] Test configuration loading
- [x] Test validation rules
- [x] Test error handling
- [x] Test different environment scenarios

## Risk Assessment
**Medium Risk** - Configuration changes could affect multiple services.

## Notes
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Consider using configuration management libraries
- Add comprehensive logging for configuration issues
- Consider implementing configuration hot-reloading for development
