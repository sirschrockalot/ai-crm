## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This story depends on Epic 1 and Epic 2 being completed. The foundation should include:
- Monolithic application structure
- Shared component library
- Lead management features (Story 2.1)
- Analytics integration (Story 2.2)

### Data Models
Based on the automation requirements, the following data models are used:

**Workflow Model:**
```typescript
interface Workflow {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  nodes: WorkflowNode[];
  edges: WorkflowEdge[];
  triggers: WorkflowTrigger[];
  isActive: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

**Workflow Node Model:**
```typescript
interface WorkflowNode {
  id: string;
  type: 'trigger' | 'condition' | 'action';
  position: { x: number; y: number };
  data: NodeData;
  config: NodeConfig;
}
```

**Automation Rule Model:**
```typescript
interface AutomationRule {
  id: string;
  workflowId: string;
  trigger: TriggerConfig;
  conditions: ConditionConfig[];
  actions: ActionConfig[];
  isActive: boolean;
  priority: number;
}
```

### API Specifications
The automation features integrate with the following API endpoints:

**Workflow Management APIs:**
- GET /api/automation/workflows - Get all workflows
- POST /api/automation/workflows - Create new workflow
- PUT /api/automation/workflows/:id - Update workflow
- DELETE /api/automation/workflows/:id - Delete workflow
- POST /api/automation/workflows/:id/execute - Execute workflow

**Automation Engine APIs:**
- POST /api/automation/triggers - Register trigger
- POST /api/automation/actions - Execute action
- GET /api/automation/executions - Get execution history
- GET /api/automation/stats - Get automation statistics

### Component Specifications
Based on the existing automation implementation, the following components should be migrated:

**WorkflowBuilder Component:**
```typescript
interface WorkflowBuilderProps {
  workflow?: Workflow;
  onSave: (workflow: Workflow) => void;
  onTest: (workflow: Workflow) => void;
  onDeploy: (workflow: Workflow) => void;
}
```

**WorkflowCanvas Component:**
```typescript
interface WorkflowCanvasProps {
  nodes: WorkflowNode[];
  edges: WorkflowEdge[];
  onNodeAdd: (node: WorkflowNode) => void;
  onNodeUpdate: (nodeId: string, data: NodeData) => void;
  onNodeDelete: (nodeId: string) => void;
  onEdgeAdd: (edge: WorkflowEdge) => void;
}
```

**AutomationStats Component:**
```typescript
interface AutomationStatsProps {
  stats: AutomationStatistics;
  period: DateRange;
  onPeriodChange: (period: DateRange) => void;
  onRefresh: () => void;
}
```

### File Locations
Based on the monolithic structure, the following structure should be created:
