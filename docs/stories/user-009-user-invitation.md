## User Story

**As an** administrator,  
**I want** to invite new users to the platform  
**So that** I can control who has access and streamline user onboarding.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Admins can send user invitations via email
- [ ] Invitation tokens are securely generated and time-limited (7 days)
- [ ] Invited users can complete registration with invitation token
- [ ] Invitation status is trackable (pending, accepted, expired)
- [ ] Invitation attempts are rate-limited (max 10 invitations per hour per admin)
- [ ] Invitation events are logged for audit purposes
- [ ] Admins can view and manage pending invitations

### Security Requirements
- [ ] Invitation tokens use cryptographically secure random generation
- [ ] Invitation links are single-use only
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents invitation spam
- [ ] All invitation activities are logged with admin and recipient details
- [ ] Invitation tokens are invalidated after use or expiration

### User Experience Requirements
- [ ] Clear invitation emails with platform branding
- [ ] Intuitive invitation acceptance flow
- [ ] Clear status indicators for invitation management
- [ ] Helpful error messages for invalid/expired invitations
- [ ] Success confirmation when invitations are sent/accepted

---

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Implementation
- Create invitation data model with status tracking
- Implement invitation API endpoints (`POST /admin/invitations`, `GET /admin/invitations`)
- Create invitation acceptance endpoint (`POST /auth/accept-invitation`)
- Add secure token generation using `crypto.randomBytes(32)`
- Implement rate limiting for invitation sending
- Add comprehensive logging for invitation events
- Integrate with existing email service

### Database Changes
- Add `user_invitations` table with fields:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `email` (string, recipient email)
  - `token` (string, hashed invitation token)
  - `invited_by` (UUID, foreign key to users - admin)
  - `status` (enum: pending, accepted, expired)
  - `expires_at` (timestamp)
  - `accepted_at` (timestamp, nullable)
  - `created_at` (timestamp)
  - `ip_address` (string, admin IP)

### Email Templates
- User invitation email with secure acceptance link
- Invitation reminder email (optional, for pending invitations)
- Invitation accepted confirmation email

## Technical Notes

### Integration Points
- **Existing User Module**: Integrates with user registration (USER-002)
- **Admin System**: Requires admin role validation
- **Email Service**: Uses existing email notification infrastructure
- **Activity Logging**: Integrates with existing logging system (USER-006)

### Invitation Flow
1. Admin sends invitation via API
2. System generates secure token and sends email
3. User clicks invitation link
4. System validates token and allows registration
5. User completes registration with invitation context
6. Invitation status updated to "accepted"

### Security Considerations
- Tokens must be cryptographically secure (32 bytes minimum)
- All tokens should be hashed before storage
- Rate limiting should be admin-based to prevent abuse
- Logging should include admin details and recipient information
- Invitation links should be single-use only

### Performance Considerations
- Token generation should be asynchronous
- Email sending should be queued to prevent blocking
- Database queries should be optimized with proper indexes
- Rate limiting should use efficient caching

---

## Risk Assessment

### Primary Risks
- **Email Delivery Issues**: Mitigation - Use reliable email service with retry logic
- **Token Security**: Mitigation - Use cryptographically secure generation and proper hashing
- **Rate Limiting Bypass**: Mitigation - Implement multiple layers of rate limiting
- **Invitation Abuse**: Mitigation - Implement admin-only access and comprehensive logging

### Rollback Plan
- Disable invitation endpoints if critical issues arise
- Revert database migration if needed
- Maintain existing user registration as fallback

---

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- USER-002: User registration workflow (for invitation acceptance)
- USER-006: User activity logging (for audit trail)
- Admin role system
- Email service infrastructure
- Rate limiting middleware

### Blocking
- None - can be developed in parallel with other stories

---

## Estimation

- **Story Points**: 3
- **Estimated Hours**: 12-16 hours
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Risk Level**: Medium
