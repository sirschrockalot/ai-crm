- `src/frontend/hooks/` - All custom hooks including service hooks
- `src/frontend/utils/` - All utility functions
- `src/frontend/pages/` - All application pages
- `src/frontend/types/` - All TypeScript type definitions

The testing must comprehensively cover all these areas while ensuring proper test organization, maintainability, and CI/CD integration.

## Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Verify all tests pass consistently across all environments
- **IV2**: Confirm performance tests meet all benchmarks and requirements
- **IV3**: Ensure accessibility and security tests validate compliance

## Next Steps
After completion of this story, the entire frontend migration will be complete with comprehensive testing and validation. The application will be ready for production deployment with full confidence in its functionality, performance, accessibility, and security.
