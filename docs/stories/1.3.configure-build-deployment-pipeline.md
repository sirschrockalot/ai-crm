## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This story depends on Stories 1.1 and 1.2 being completed. The foundation includes:
- Monolithic Next.js application structure with TypeScript configuration
- Shared component library with 7 core UI components, 4 layout components, and 3 form components
- Comprehensive utility functions and custom hooks
- Design system with Chakra UI theme
- Storybook documentation setup
- All components have unit tests and are responsive/accessible
- Build compilation is successful with no TypeScript errors

### Data Models
No specific data models are required for this infrastructure story. The focus is on build and deployment configuration.

### API Specifications
The deployment pipeline will need to handle the following API integrations:
- Backend API endpoints (configured per environment) [Source: Architecture_Overview_Wholesaling_CRM.md#Stack Overview]
- Authentication services (Google OAuth 2.0 + JWT) [Source: Architecture_Overview_Wholesaling_CRM.md#Stack Overview]
- External service integrations (Twilio, Google OAuth, etc.) [Source: Architecture_Overview_Wholesaling_CRM.md#Stack Overview]
- Monitoring and logging services (Prometheus + Grafana) [Source: Architecture_Overview_Wholesaling_CRM.md#Stack Overview]

### Component Specifications
No new components are required for this story. The focus is on optimizing the build and deployment of existing components from Story 1.2.

### File Locations
Based on the architecture overview and previous stories, the following configuration files should be created:

```
src/frontend/
├── next.config.js              # Next.js configuration (already exists, needs optimization)
├── docker-compose.yml          # Docker Compose configuration
├── Dockerfile                  # Docker container configuration
├── .env.example               # Environment variables template
├── .env.development           # Development environment variables
├── .env.staging              # Staging environment variables
├── .env.production           # Production environment variables
└── scripts/
    ├── build.sh              # Build script
    ├── deploy.sh             # Deployment script
    └── health-check.sh       # Health check script
```

### Testing Requirements
Based on the architecture and previous story context:
- Unit tests for build configuration and optimization
- Integration tests for Docker containerization
- E2E tests for deployment pipeline
- Performance tests for build optimization
- Security tests for environment configuration

### Technical Constraints
From the architecture documentation:
- **Technology Stack**: Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Chakra UI [Source: Architecture_Overview_Wholesaling_CRM.md#Stack Overview]
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose (GCP-compatible) [Source: Architecture_Overview_Wholesaling_CRM.md#Stack Overview]
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana [Source: Architecture_Overview_Wholesaling_CRM.md#Stack Overview]
- **Security**: RBAC, tenant guards, container hardening [Source: Architecture_Overview_Wholesaling_CRM.md#Stack Overview]
- **Performance**: Code splitting, lazy loading, CDN for static assets [Source: Architecture_Overview_Wholesaling_CRM.md#Deployment Strategy]

### Environment Configuration
Based on the architecture deployment strategy:
- **Development**: Local Docker Compose with hot reloading
- **Staging**: GCP Compute Engine with staging environment
- **Production**: GCP Compute Engine with auto-scaling, load balancer, SSL certificates, CDN

### Performance Optimization Requirements
From the architecture scalability considerations:
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Load balancer, database sharding, Redis caching [Source: Architecture_Overview_Wholesaling_CRM.md#Scalability Considerations]
- **Performance Monitoring**: Application metrics, infrastructure metrics, user experience metrics [Source: Architecture_Overview_Wholesaling_CRM.md#Performance Monitoring]
- **Disaster Recovery**: Automated backups, multi-region deployment, monitoring alerts [Source: Architecture_Overview_Wholesaling_CRM.md#Disaster Recovery]

### Security Considerations
From the architecture security section:
- **Container Hardening**: Secure Docker configurations
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control for deployment
- **Tenant Guards**: Multi-tenant security for deployment
- **SSL Certificates**: Managed SSL certificates for production
- **Environment Variables**: Secure management of sensitive configuration

### Integration Points
The deployment pipeline must integrate with:
- **Backend Services**: NestJS API running on port 3000 [Source: Architecture_Overview_Wholesaling_CRM.md#Deployment Strategy]
- **Database**: MongoDB with multi-tenant awareness [Source: Architecture_Overview_Wholesaling_CRM.md#Stack Overview]
- **Caching**: Redis for session and data caching [Source: Architecture_Overview_Wholesaling_CRM.md#Deployment Strategy]
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana for metrics and dashboards [Source: Architecture_Overview_Wholesaling_CRM.md#Stack Overview]

### Project Structure Notes
The current project structure from Story 1.2 includes:
- `src/frontend/components/ui/` - 7 core UI components with tests and stories
- `src/frontend/components/layout/` - 4 layout components
- `src/frontend/components/forms/` - 3 form components
- `src/frontend/hooks/` - 8 custom hooks including service hooks
- `src/frontend/utils/` - 5 utility modules
- `src/frontend/design-system/` - Chakra UI theme configuration
- `src/frontend/types/` - Comprehensive TypeScript types
- `src/frontend/.storybook/` - Storybook documentation setup

The build and deployment configuration must preserve this structure while optimizing for production deployment.

## Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Verify that build process completes successfully with optimized bundles
- **IV2**: Confirm that deployment to staging environment works with all features
- **IV3**: Ensure production deployment is successful and performant with monitoring

## Next Steps
After completion of this story, the monolithic frontend application will have a complete build and deployment pipeline ready for production use. The next epic (Epic 2: Lead Management Feature Migration) can proceed with migrating specific features using the established foundation.
