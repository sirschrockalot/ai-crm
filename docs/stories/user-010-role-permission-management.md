## User Story

**As an** administrator,  
**I want** to assign roles and permissions to users  
**So that** I can control access to different features and data.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented

- [ ] Role changes are immediately effective

---

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Implementation
- Create role and permission data models
- Implement RBAC middleware and guards
- Create role assignment API endpoints
- Add permission checking decorators
- Implement role change logging
- Define default role hierarchy
- Add permission validation middleware

### Database Changes
- Add `roles` table with fields:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `name` (string, unique)
  - `description` (text)
  - `permissions` (JSONB, array of permissions)
  - `created_at` (timestamp)
  - `updated_at` (timestamp)

- Add `user_roles` table with fields:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `user_id` (UUID, foreign key to users)
  - `role_id` (UUID, foreign key to roles)
  - `assigned_by` (UUID, foreign key to users - admin)
  - `assigned_at` (timestamp)
  - `expires_at` (timestamp, nullable)

- Add `permissions` table with fields:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `name` (string, unique)
  - `description` (text)
  - `resource` (string, what resource this applies to)
  - `action` (string, what action is allowed)
  - `created_at` (timestamp)

### Frontend Implementation
- Create role management UI for admins
- Implement permission matrix display
- Add role assignment interface
- Create permission denied feedback components

### Task 3: Create RBAC API Endpoints
- [ ] Create role management endpoints (CRUD)

### Task 4: Implement Permission Enforcement
- [ ] Add permission checks to existing endpoints
- [ ] Create permission decorators for controllers
- [ ] Implement permission-based route guards

- [ ] Define system default roles (admin, user, guest)
- [ ] Create default permission sets
- [ ] Implement role assignment for new users
- [ ] Add role migration for existing users

## Technical Notes

### Integration Points
- **Existing User Module**: Integrates with user management (USER-001)
- **Authentication System**: Uses existing auth guards and decorators
- **Activity Logging**: Integrates with existing logging system (USER-006)
- **Admin Interface**: Requires admin role validation

### Default Role Structure

#### Admin Role
```json
{
  "name": "admin",
  "permissions": [
    "users:read",
    "users:write",
    "users:delete",
    "roles:read",
    "roles:write",
    "roles:delete",
    "system:admin"
  ]
}
```

#### User Role
```json
{
  "name": "user",
  "permissions": [
    "profile:read",
    "profile:write",
    "leads:read",
    "leads:write"
  ]
}
```

#### Guest Role
```json
{
  "name": "guest",
  "permissions": [
    "public:read"
  ]
}
```

### Permission Format
Permissions follow the format: `resource:action`
- `users:read` - Can read user data
- `users:write` - Can create/update users
- `users:delete` - Can delete users
- `system:admin` - Full system access

### Security Considerations
- All permission checks must be enforced at the API level
- Role assignments should require admin privileges
- Permission inheritance should be carefully controlled
- All role changes must be logged for audit purposes
- Permission checks should be cached for performance

### Performance Considerations
- Permission checks should be cached to avoid database hits
- Role assignments should be indexed for quick lookups
- Permission inheritance should be pre-calculated
- RBAC middleware should be optimized for minimal overhead

---

## Risk Assessment

### Primary Risks
- **Permission Bypass**: Mitigation - Comprehensive testing and security review
- **Performance Impact**: Mitigation - Implement caching and optimize queries
- **Role Confusion**: Mitigation - Clear documentation and intuitive UI
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Mitigation - Regular security audits and testing

### Rollback Plan
- Disable RBAC enforcement if critical issues arise
- Revert database migrations if needed
- Maintain fallback to basic admin/user roles

---

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- USER-001: User management module (for user context)
- USER-006: User activity logging (for audit trail)
- Authentication system with guards
- Admin role system

### Blocking
- None - can be developed in parallel with other stories

---

## Estimation

- **Story Points**: 5
- **Estimated Hours**: 20-24 hours
- **Complexity**: High
- **Risk Level**: High
