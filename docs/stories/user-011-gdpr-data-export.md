- Integrate with existing file storage system

### Database Changes
- Add `data_exports` table with fields:
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `user_id` (UUID, foreign key to users)
  - `status` (enum: pending, processing, completed, failed)
  - `format` (string, json/csv)
  - `file_path` (string, path to generated file)
  - `file_size` (integer, bytes)
  - `expires_at` (timestamp, when file is deleted)
  - `created_at` (timestamp)
  - `completed_at` (timestamp, nullable)
  - `error_message` (text, nullable)

### File Storage
- Secure file storage for export files
- Automatic file cleanup after expiration
- File access logging for security audit

## Technical Notes

### Integration Points
- **Existing User Module**: Integrates with user management (USER-001)
- **Activity Logging**: Uses existing logging system (USER-006)
- **File Storage**: Integrates with existing file storage infrastructure
- **Job Queue**: Uses existing job processing system

### GDPR Data Structure
```json
{
  "user": {
    "profile": {
      "id": "uuid",
      "email": "user@example.com",
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "createdAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
      "updatedAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
    },
    "preferences": {
      "emailNotifications": {...},
      "ui": {...},
      "privacy": {...}
    },
    "activity": [
      {
        "action": "login",
        "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "ipAddress": "192.168.1.1"
      }
    ],
    "roles": [
      {
        "name": "user",
        "assignedAt": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
      }
    ]
  },
  "metadata": {
    "exportDate": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "dataRetention": "7 years",
    "processingPurposes": ["account management", "service delivery"],
    "thirdPartySharing": ["email service provider", "analytics"]
  }
}
```

### Data Sources to Include
- User profile information
- User preferences and settings
- User activity logs
- User roles and permissions
- User invitations (if applicable)
- Password reset requests
- Account status changes
- Login/logout history

### Security Considerations
- Export files should be encrypted at rest
- File access should require authentication
- Files should be automatically deleted after download
- Export requests should be rate-limited
- All export activities should be logged

### Performance Considerations
- Export processing should be asynchronous
- Large exports should be chunked
- File storage should be optimized
- Export requests should be queued to prevent system overload

---

## Risk Assessment

### Primary Risks
- **Data Privacy**: Mitigation - Implement proper data redaction and access controls
- **Performance Impact**: Mitigation - Use asynchronous processing and job queues
- **Storage Costs**: Mitigation - Implement automatic file cleanup
- **Compliance Issues**: Mitigation - Regular GDPR compliance audits

### Rollback Plan
- Disable export endpoints if critical issues arise
- Revert database migration if needed
- Maintain manual export capability as fallback

---

## Dependencies

### Prerequisites
- USER-001: User management module (for user data)
- USER-006: User activity logging (for activity data)
- File storage infrastructure
- Job queue system
- Email notification system

### Blocking
- None - can be developed in parallel with other stories
