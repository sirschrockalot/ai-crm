## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This story depends on Stories 1.1, 1.2, and 4.1 being completed. The foundation includes:
- Monolithic Next.js application structure with TypeScript
- Shared component library with UI components, layout components, and form components
- Automation components already migrated (Story 4.1)
- Shared hooks and utilities for data handling and state management
- Design system with Chakra UI theme

### Data Models
Based on the architecture and previous stories:
- **Workflow Configuration Models**: Workflow settings and preferences
- **Execution Models**: Workflow execution history and status tracking
- **Collaboration Models**: Workflow sharing and team management
- **Template Models**: Workflow templates and presets

### API Specifications
The automation pages will integrate with:
- **Automation API**: `/api/automation` for workflow management [Source: Architecture_Overview_Wholesaling_CRM.md#Backend Structure]
- **Execution API**: `/api/executions` for execution monitoring
- **Collaboration API**: `/api/collaboration` for workflow sharing
- **Template API**: `/api/templates` for workflow templates
- **Real-time API**: WebSocket connections for execution updates

### Component Specifications
The automation pages will use existing components from Story 1.2:
- **Layout Components**: Sidebar, Header, Navigation for automation layout
- **UI Components**: Card, Table, Modal for data display and interactions
- **Form Components**: For automation configuration and settings
- **Loading Components**: For automation operations and data loading
- **Error Components**: For error handling and display

### Testing Requirements
Based on the architecture and previous story context:
- **Unit Tests**: Test all automation page components
- **Integration Tests**: Test workflow management and execution flows
- **E2E Tests**: Test complete automation workflows
- **Responsive Tests**: Test automation pages on different devices
- **Performance Tests**: Test automation page loading and interactions

### Technical Constraints
From the architecture documentation:
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for execution status [Source: Architecture_Overview_Wholesaling_CRM.md#Stack Overview]
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Chakra UI [Source: Architecture_Overview_Wholesaling_CRM.md#Stack Overview]
- **State Management**: React hooks with proper TypeScript types
- **Performance**: Optimized page loading and real-time updates
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance for automation interfaces

### Integration Points
The automation pages must integrate with:
- **Backend Automation API**: NestJS automation endpoints [Source: Architecture_Overview_Wholesaling_CRM.md#Backend Structure]
- **Real-time Data**: WebSocket connections for execution updates
- **Collaboration Services**: Workflow sharing and team management
- **Template Services**: Workflow templates and presets
- **Authentication**: Role-based access to automation features

### Performance Considerations
From the architecture scalability considerations:
- **Page Loading**: Optimized automation page loading
- **Real-time Updates**: Efficient WebSocket data handling
- **State Management**: Optimized workflow state updates
- **Caching**: Implement caching for workflow configurations
- **Bundle Optimization**: Minimize automation page bundle size

### Security Considerations
From the architecture security section:
- **Workflow Access**: Role-based access to workflow management
- **Collaboration Security**: Secure workflow sharing and collaboration
- **Execution Security**: Secure workflow execution monitoring
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure workflow data is properly protected
- **Audit Logging**: Log automation access and operations

### Project Structure Notes
The current project structure from Story 1.2 includes:
- `src/frontend/components/ui/` - 7 core UI components
- `src/frontend/components/layout/` - 4 layout components
- `src/frontend/hooks/` - 8 custom hooks
- `src/frontend/utils/` - 5 utility modules
- `src/frontend/pages/` - Feature pages

The automation pages must preserve this structure while providing comprehensive automation functionality with proper responsive design and user experience.

## Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Verify all automation pages load correctly with proper data
- **IV2**: Confirm workflow management interfaces work as expected
- **IV3**: Ensure responsive design works on all devices and screen sizes

## Next Steps
After completion of this story, the automation pages and workflows will be fully migrated to the monolithic structure. The next story (Story 4.3: Integrate Automation with Shared Services) can proceed with integrating automation features with shared services and utilities.
