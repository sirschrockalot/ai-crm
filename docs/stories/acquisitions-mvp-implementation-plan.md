## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### **Mockup Integration Strategy:**
- **Design Fidelity:** All components must match their respective mockups exactly
- **Component Mapping:** Each component directly implements the design from its mockup file
- **Styling Override:** Use Chakra UI components but override all styling to match mockup designs
- **Visual Consistency:** Maintain exact colors, fonts, spacing, and visual elements from mockups

### **Component Architecture:**
```
src/frontend/components/dashboard/
â”œâ”€â”€ AcquisitionsDashboard.tsx (NEW - follows acquisitions-dashboard.html exactly)

src/frontend/components/leads/
â”œâ”€â”€ LeadQueue.tsx (NEW - follows lead-queue.html exactly)
â”œâ”€â”€ LeadDetail.tsx (NEW - follows lead-detail.html exactly)
â””â”€â”€ LeadStatusBadge.tsx (NEW - reusable status component with mockup styling)
```

### **API Integration:**
- **Lead Management:** Use existing `/api/leads/*` endpoints
- **Authentication:** Leverage existing auth system
- **RBAC:** Use existing role-based access control
- **Real-time:** Implement using existing websocket setup

### **Data Flow:**
1. **Dashboard:** Fetches aggregated metrics and recent activity
2. **Queue:** Fetches filtered lead list with pagination
3. **Detail:** Fetches individual lead data and history
4. **Updates:** Real-time sync across all components
