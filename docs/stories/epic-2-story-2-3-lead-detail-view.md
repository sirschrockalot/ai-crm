### **Critical APIs & Interfaces**

#### **Lead Detail API Response:**
```typescript
// backend/src/leads/leads.controller.ts
@Get('/leads/:id')
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)
async getLeadDetail(
  @Param('id') id: string,
  @Request() req: any
) {
  return this.leadsService.getLeadDetail(id, req.user.tenant_id);
}

// Response includes:
interface LeadDetail {
  lead: Lead;
  communications: Communication[];
  activities: Activity[];
  relatedDeals: Deal[];
  matchedBuyers: Buyer[];
  aiSummary?: string;
  aiTags?: string[];
}
```

#### **Inline Editing:**
```typescript
// frontend/src/components/leads/LeadInfo.tsx
const LeadInfo = ({ lead, onUpdate }) => {
  const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false);
  const { register, handleSubmit } = useForm();

  const onSubmit = async (data) => {
    await updateLead(lead._id, data);
    setIsEditing(false);
    onUpdate();
  };
};
```

### **Data Models**

#### **Activity Timeline:**
```typescript
// backend/src/activities/activity.schema.ts
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  tenant_id: ObjectId,
  user_id: ObjectId,
  type: String,                   // lead_created, lead_updated, communication_sent, etc.
  entity_type: String,            // lead, buyer, deal, communication
  entity_id: ObjectId,            // Reference to the related entity
  description: String,
  metadata: Object,               // Flexible metadata for different activity types
  ip_address: String,
  user_agent: String,
  created_at: Date
}
```

### **Required Environment Variables**
```bash
# Backend .env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/presidential_digs_crm
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
```
