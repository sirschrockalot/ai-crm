  const [isEditing, setIsEditing] = useState(false);
  const { register, handleSubmit } = useForm();

  const onSubmit = async (data) => {
    await updateLead(lead._id, data);
    setIsEditing(false);
    onUpdate();
  };
};
```

### **Data Models**

#### **Activity Timeline:**

{
  _id: ObjectId,
  tenant_id: ObjectId,
  user_id: ObjectId,
  type: String,                   // lead_created, lead_updated, communication_sent, etc.
  entity_type: String,            // lead, buyer, deal, communication
  entity_id: ObjectId,            // Reference to the related entity
  description: String,
  metadata: Object,               // Flexible metadata for different activity types
  ip_address: String,
  user_agent: String,
  created_at: Date
}
