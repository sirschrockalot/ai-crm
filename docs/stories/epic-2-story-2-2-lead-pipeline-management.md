# Story 2.2: Lead Pipeline Management

## üìã Story Information

**Epic:** Epic 2: Lead Management System  
**Story ID:** 2.2  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Points:** 13  
**Dependencies:** Story 2.1 (Lead Creation)  

## üéØ Goal & Context

### **User Story**
```
As a user
I want to view and manage leads in a pipeline view
So that I can track lead progress and status
```

### **Business Context**
This story implements a Kanban-style pipeline view that allows users to visualize and manage leads through different stages of the sales process. It provides drag-and-drop functionality, filtering, and real-time updates to help teams track lead progress efficiently.

### **Success Criteria**
- User can view leads organized by status (new, contacted, under_contract, closed, lost)
- User can drag and drop leads between status columns
- User can filter leads by assigned user, tags, or search terms
- User can see lead details in a card format
- User can quickly update lead status
- Pipeline view is responsive and works on mobile

### **Critical APIs & Interfaces**

#### **Pipeline Data Structure:**
```typescript
// frontend/src/types/leads.ts
interface LeadPipeline {
  new: Lead[];
  contacted: Lead[];
  under_contract: Lead[];
  closed: Lead[];
  lost: Lead[];
}

interface Lead {
  _id: string;
  name: string;
  phone: string;
  email?: string;
  status: 'new' | 'contacted' | 'under_contract' | 'closed' | 'lost';
  assigned_to?: string;
  tags: string[];
  last_contacted?: Date;
  next_follow_up?: Date;
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'urgent';
  estimated_value?: number;
  created_at: Date;
  updated_at: Date;
}
```

#### **Status Update API:**
```typescript
// backend/src/leads/leads.controller.ts
@Put('/leads/:id/status')
@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard, RolesGuard)
@Roles('acquisition_rep', 'disposition_manager', 'admin')
async updateLeadStatus(
  @Param('id') id: string,
  @Body() updateStatusDto: UpdateLeadStatusDto,
  @Request() req: any
) {
  return this.leadsService.updateLeadStatus(id, updateStatusDto, req.user.tenant_id);
}
```

### **Data Models**

#### **Lead Status Tracking:**
```typescript
// backend/src/leads/lead.schema.ts
{
  status: String,                 // new, contacted, under_contract, closed, lost
  status_history: [{
    status: String,
    changed_by: ObjectId,
    changed_at: Date,
    notes: String
  }],
  last_status_change: Date,
  next_follow_up: Date,
  priority: String,               // low, medium, high, urgent
  assigned_to: ObjectId,
  tags: [String]
}
```

### **Required Environment Variables**
```bash
# Backend .env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/presidential_digs_crm
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
```
