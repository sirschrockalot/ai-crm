# Implement Service Discovery & Load Balancing - User Story

## Story Title
Implement Service Discovery & Load Balancing - Brownfield Addition

## User Story
As a **DevOps Engineer/System Administrator**,
I want **service discovery and load balancing capabilities for the microservices**,
So that **services can communicate with each other reliably and scale horizontally based on demand**.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**
- Integrates with: All extracted microservices (auth, leads, buyers, users), existing Kubernetes infrastructure, frontend API gateway
- Technology: Kubernetes, Docker, existing service mesh or API gateway patterns, monitoring infrastructure
- Follows pattern: Kubernetes-native service discovery and load balancing
- Touch points: Inter-service communication, API routing, health checks, monitoring endpoints

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Service discovery mechanism enables microservices to find and communicate with each other
2. Load balancing distributes traffic across multiple instances of the same service
3. Health checks monitor service availability and automatically route traffic to healthy instances
4. Service mesh or API gateway provides unified routing and monitoring

**Integration Requirements:**
5. Existing frontend API calls continue to work unchanged
6. New service discovery follows existing Kubernetes patterns
7. Integration with monitoring and logging systems maintains current behavior
8. Service-to-service communication is reliable and performant

**Quality Requirements:**
9. Changes are covered by comprehensive infrastructure tests
10. Configuration is documented and tested
11. No regression in existing service communication verified

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** Implement Kubernetes-native service discovery and load balancing while maintaining existing API contracts
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow current Kubernetes deployment and service patterns
- **Key Constraints:** Must maintain backward compatibility and not disrupt existing service communication

## Definition of Done

- [x] Service discovery mechanism is functional and tested
- [x] Load balancing distributes traffic correctly across service instances
- [x] Health checks monitor all services and route traffic appropriately
- [x] Service mesh or API gateway provides unified routing
- [x] All inter-service communication is reliable
- [x] Comprehensive tests cover infrastructure functionality
- [x] Configuration is documented and tested
- [x] No regression in existing service communication

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** Breaking existing service communication during infrastructure changes
- **Mitigation:** Incremental implementation with comprehensive testing, maintain existing communication patterns
- **Rollback:** Maintain ability to revert to previous infrastructure configuration if needed

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [x] No breaking changes to existing service APIs
- [x] Service communication maintains current behavior
- [x] Frontend integration remains unchanged
- [x] Performance impact is negligible
