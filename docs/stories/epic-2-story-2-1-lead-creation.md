# Story 2.1: Lead Creation

## üìã Story Information

**Epic:** Epic 2: Lead Management System  
**Story ID:** 2.1  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Points:** 8  
**Dependencies:** Epic 1 (Authentication & User Management)  

## üéØ Goal & Context

### **User Story**
```
As an acquisition rep
I want to create new leads quickly
So that I can capture seller information efficiently
```

### **Business Context**
This story enables acquisition representatives to efficiently capture and manage seller leads. It provides a streamlined interface for entering lead information with validation and automatic assignment to the current tenant. This is a core business function that directly impacts the wholesaling workflow.

### **Success Criteria**
- User can create leads with required fields (name, phone)
- User can add optional fields (email, address, property details)
- User can assign leads to team members
- User can add tags and notes to leads
- Lead is automatically assigned to current tenant
- Lead status is set to "new" by default
- Form validation prevents invalid data entry

{ tenant_id: 1, phone: 1 }                     // Duplicate detection
{ tenant_id: 1, email: 1 }                     // Email queries
{ tenant_id: 1, source: 1 }                    // Source analytics
{ tenant_id: 1, tags: 1 }                      // Tag filtering
{ tenant_id: 1, last_contacted: -1 }           // Recent activity
{ tenant_id: 1, next_follow_up: 1 }            // Follow-up scheduling
{ tenant_id: 1, name: "text", phone: "text" }  // Full-text search
```

### **Required Environment Variables**
