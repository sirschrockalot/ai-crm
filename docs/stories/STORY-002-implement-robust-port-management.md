# Story: Implement Robust Port Management

## Story ID
`STORY-002`

## Status
**✅ COMPLETED** - All requirements implemented and tested

## Epic
[EPIC-002: Fix Remaining Runtime Errors](../epics/fix-remaining-runtime-errors.md)

## Type
**Feature**

## Priority
**High**

## Story Points
**2**

## Description
Implement a comprehensive port management system that automatically handles port conflicts, provides fallback options, and ensures reliable service startup across different environments.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Automatic port detection and selection
- [x] Fallback port configuration when primary port is busy
- [x] Port reservation mechanism to prevent conflicts
- [x] Clear logging of port allocation decisions
- [x] Support for multiple environments (dev, staging, prod)

## Technical Requirements
- Port availability checking utility
- Dynamic port allocation
- Port reservation system
- Environment-specific port configuration
- Port conflict resolution strategies

## Implementation Details
1. **Port Management Utility**
   - Create `PortManager` class/service
   - Implement port availability checking
   - Add port range validation
   - Implement port reservation

2. **Configuration Enhancement**
   - Add port ranges to environment files
   - Implement fallback port sequences
   - Add port allocation logging

3. **Integration**
   - Integrate with NestJS startup process
   - Add port management to main.ts
   - Implement port validation middleware

## Dependencies
- Environment configuration files
- Backend startup process
- Configuration management system

## Definition of Done
- [x] Port management system is implemented
- [x] All services use the new port management
- [x] Tests cover port conflict scenarios
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Code review completed

## Testing
- [x] Test port availability checking
- [x] Test fallback port selection
- [x] Test port reservation
- [x] Test multiple environment scenarios

## Risk Assessment
**Medium Risk** - New port management system could introduce complexity.

## Notes
- Consider using established port management libraries
- Ensure backward compatibility
- Add comprehensive logging for debugging
- Consider port allocation for microservices architecture

## Completion Summary

**✅ STORY COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

### What Was Delivered:
- **EnhancedPortManager**: Comprehensive port management class with singleton pattern
- **Port Configuration**: Environment-specific configuration with fallback strategies
- **Integration**: Full integration with NestJS startup process
- **Testing**: Complete test coverage for all port conflict scenarios
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive system documentation and usage guides
- **Development Tools**: Enhanced scripts for port management and troubleshooting

### Key Features Implemented:
- Automatic port detection and selection
- Fallback port configuration with configurable ranges
- Port reservation mechanism with timeout handling
- Environment-specific strategies (dev: aggressive, staging: fallback, prod: conservative)
- Health monitoring and process tracking
- Graceful shutdown with port cleanup
- Comprehensive error handling and diagnostics

### Files Created/Modified:
- `src/backend/src/utils/enhanced-port-manager.ts` - Main port management class
- `src/backend/config/port.config.ts` - Environment-specific configuration
- `src/backend/src/main.ts` - Integration with startup process
- `src/backend/src/utils/enhanced-port-manager.spec.ts` - Test coverage
- `src/backend/docs/port-management.md` - System documentation

### Ready for Production:
The robust port management system is production-ready and provides enterprise-level port conflict resolution with comprehensive monitoring and fallback strategies across all environments.
