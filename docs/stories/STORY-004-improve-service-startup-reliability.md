./scripts/test-health-checks.sh
```

Run tests for new simplified services:
```bash
npm test -- --testPathPattern=unified-validation.service.spec.ts
npm test -- --testPathPattern=simplified-startup.service.spec.ts
npm test -- --testPathPattern=simplified-process-manager.service.spec.ts

1. Circuit breaker pattern for external dependencies
2. Prometheus metrics integration
3. Dynamic configuration changes
4. Health check plugins system
5. Startup optimization for parallel service startup
6. **Validation rules engine for dynamic validation**

8. **Configuration management improvements**

### **Long-Term Fixes Summary** ✅
The following long-term fixes have been successfully implemented:

1. **Consolidate Validation Systems** ✅
   - Replaced multiple validation approaches with single `UnifiedValidationService`
   - Eliminated duplicate validation code and complex schemas
   - Single source of truth for all validation rules

2. **Simplify Startup Process** ✅
   - Replaced complex `StartupService` with `SimplifiedStartupService`
   - Removed redundant validation layers and dependency management
   - Single validation step with clear ready/not-ready state

3. **Fix Process Management** ✅
   - Replaced complex `port-manager.ts` (1190+ lines) with `SimplifiedProcessManagerService`
   - Clean port availability checking without file-based tracking
   - Simple process lifecycle management

4. **Environment Variable Handling** ✅
   - Created `simplified-environment.config.ts` with proper empty vs undefined handling
   - Helper functions for consistent environment value extraction
   - Better default value management and type conversion

These fixes result in a more maintainable, reliable, and performant startup system that follows the principle of "do one thing well" with clear separation of concerns.
