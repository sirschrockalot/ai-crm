## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This story depends on Epic 1 being completed and Story 2.1 (Lead Management) being in progress. The foundation should include:
- Monolithic application structure
- Shared component library with chart components
- Lead management data integration
- API service patterns

### Data Models
Based on the analytics requirements, the following data models are used:

**Analytics Dashboard Model:**
```typescript
interface AnalyticsDashboard {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  widgets: DashboardWidget[];
  layout: WidgetLayout[];
  lastUpdated: Date;
}
```

**Performance Metrics Model:**
```typescript
interface PerformanceMetrics {
  totalLeads: number;
  conversionRate: number;
  averageResponseTime: number;
  revenueGenerated: number;
  period: DateRange;
  trends: MetricTrend[];
}
```

**Team Performance Model:**
```typescript
interface TeamPerformance {
  userId: string;
  userName: string;
  leadsAssigned: number;
  leadsConverted: number;
  conversionRate: number;
  responseTime: number;
  revenueGenerated: number;
  period: DateRange;
}
```

### API Specifications
The analytics features integrate with the following API endpoints:

**Analytics APIs:**
- GET /api/analytics/dashboard - Get dashboard data
- GET /api/analytics/performance - Get performance metrics
- GET /api/analytics/conversions - Get conversion data
- GET /api/analytics/team-performance - Get team performance
- POST /api/analytics/reports - Generate custom reports
- GET /api/analytics/reports/:id - Get report data

**Data Integration APIs:**
- GET /api/leads/analytics - Get lead analytics data
- GET /api/communications/analytics - Get communication analytics
- GET /api/users/performance - Get user performance data

### Component Specifications
Based on the existing analytics implementation, the following components should be migrated:

**AnalyticsDashboard Component:**
```typescript
interface AnalyticsDashboardProps {
  dashboard: AnalyticsDashboard;
  onWidgetUpdate: (widgetId: string, config: any) => void;
  onLayoutChange: (layout: WidgetLayout[]) => void;
  refreshData: () => void;
}
```

**PerformanceMetrics Component:**
```typescript
interface PerformanceMetricsProps {
  metrics: PerformanceMetrics;
  period: DateRange;
  onPeriodChange: (period: DateRange) => void;
  isLoading?: boolean;
}
```

**ConversionCharts Component:**
```typescript
interface ConversionChartsProps {
  conversionData: ConversionData[];
  funnelData: FunnelData[];
  onFilterChange: (filters: ConversionFilters) => void;
}
```

### File Locations
Based on the monolithic structure, the following structure should be created:

### Testing Requirements
- All analytics components should have comprehensive unit tests
- Integration tests should verify data flow and API interactions
- Performance tests should ensure acceptable load times with large datasets
- Real-time data updates should be tested
- Chart rendering and interactivity should be validated

### Technical Constraints
- Must integrate with lead management data from Story 2.1
- Must use shared chart components from Story 1.2
- Must maintain real-time data synchronization
- Must handle large datasets efficiently
- Must provide responsive design for all screen sizes

### Testing
**Testing Standards:**
- Unit tests for all analytics components
- Integration tests for data flow and API interactions
- Performance testing for large datasets
- Real-time data synchronization testing
- Chart rendering and interactivity testing

**Testing Frameworks:**
- Jest and React Testing Library for unit tests
- Cypress or Playwright for end-to-end tests
- Performance testing with Lighthouse
- Chart testing with visual regression testing

**Specific Testing Requirements:**
- Test dashboard widget rendering and updates
- Test chart data visualization and interactivity
