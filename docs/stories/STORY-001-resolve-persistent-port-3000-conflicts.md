# Story: Resolve Persistent Port 3000 Conflicts

## Status
**✅ COMPLETED** - All acceptance criteria met, comprehensive testing implemented, documentation complete

## Story ID
`STORY-001`

## Epic
[EPIC-002: Fix Remaining Runtime Errors](../epics/fix-remaining-runtime-errors.md)

## Type
**Bug Fix**

## Priority
**Critical**

## Story Points
**3**

## Description
The backend service continues to encounter "EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000" errors even after previous fixes. This indicates that the port conflict resolution is not permanent and needs a comprehensive solution.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Backend starts successfully without port conflicts
- [x] Port 3000 is properly released when services stop
- [x] No orphaned processes remain using port 3000
- [x] Port conflicts are automatically resolved
- [x] Clear error messages when conflicts occur

## Technical Requirements
- Implement proper process cleanup on service shutdown
- Add port availability checking before startup
- Implement automatic port finding if default port is busy
- Add process monitoring to detect orphaned processes
- Implement graceful shutdown procedures

## Implementation Details
1. **Process Cleanup Enhancement**
   - Modify NestJS application to properly handle SIGTERM/SIGINT signals
   - Ensure all connections are closed before process exit
   - Add timeout handling for graceful shutdown

2. **Port Management**
   - Add port availability checking in main.ts
   - Implement fallback port selection
   - Add port reservation mechanism

3. **Process Monitoring**
   - Add startup checks for existing processes
   - Implement process ID tracking
   - Add cleanup scripts for development environment

## Dependencies
- Backend main.ts configuration
- Process management scripts
- Environment configuration

## Definition of Done
- [x] Backend starts consistently without port conflicts
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] Code review completed
- [x] No regression in existing functionality

## Testing
- [x] Test service startup multiple times
- [x] Test graceful shutdown
- [x] Test port conflict scenarios
- [x] Test process cleanup

## Risk Assessment
**High Risk** - Port conflicts could indicate deeper architectural issues with process management.

## Implementation Summary

### Completed Components

1. **Enhanced Port Manager (`src/utils/port-manager.ts`)**
   - ✅ Process tracking with automatic cleanup
   - ✅ Port availability checking and fallback
   - ✅ Port reservation and locking mechanism
   - ✅ Graceful shutdown coordination
   - ✅ Comprehensive port health monitoring

2. **Enhanced Bootstrap (`src/main.ts`)**
   - ✅ Automatic port conflict detection
   - ✅ Enhanced error handling with diagnostics
   - ✅ Port health checking before startup
   - ✅ Retry logic for port reservation
   - ✅ Comprehensive troubleshooting information

3. **Development Scripts**
   - ✅ `dev:cleanup` - Standard port cleanup
   - ✅ `dev:force-cleanup` - Aggressive cleanup
   - ✅ `dev:status` - Port and process status
   - ✅ `dev:health` - Port health analysis
   - ✅ `dev:kill-port` - Kill processes on specific port
   - ✅ `dev:reset` - Reset process tracking
   - ✅ `test:port-conflicts` - End-to-end testing

4. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - ✅ Unit tests for port management functions
   - ✅ Integration tests for port conflict scenarios
   - ✅ Bootstrap function tests with mocking
   - ✅ End-to-end test script for real scenarios

5. **Documentation**
   - ✅ Comprehensive port conflict resolution guide
   - ✅ Troubleshooting procedures
   - ✅ Best practices and configuration
   - ✅ API documentation and examples

### Key Features

- **Automatic Conflict Resolution**: System automatically finds alternative ports
- **Process Tracking**: Monitors and cleans up orphaned processes
- **Port Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive health checks and diagnostics
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup on service termination
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Clear error messages with troubleshooting steps
- **Development Tools**: Comprehensive scripts for development workflow

### Testing Results

All acceptance criteria have been met and verified through:
- Unit tests covering all port management functions
- Integration tests simulating real port conflicts
- End-to-end tests with actual port conflict scenarios
- Manual testing of all development scripts

## Notes
- ✅ Previous fixes were temporary workarounds - **RESOLVED**
- ✅ Need to implement permanent solution - **IMPLEMENTED**
- ✅ Consider using process managers like PM2 for production - **DOCUMENTED**
- ✅ May need to review the entire startup/shutdown flow - **COMPLETED**
