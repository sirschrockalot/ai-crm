## **6️⃣ Live Prospecting Role Play (3–4 minutes)**

**You:**

“Do you currently prospect for new business? If so, how?”

### **If they say “by phone” (ideal):**

**You:**

“Great. Let’s role-play for a minute.

 I just picked up the phone and said hello…  
 **Go.**”

Say nothing else.

✔ Evaluate:

* Opening confidence

* Pace and tone

* Clarity

* Ability to handle silence

* Natural flow vs robotic script

### **If they say “networking” or something else:**

Adapt the role play — but still make them **sell you**.

This tests composure, not perfection.
