- [x] Buyer analytics and performance tracking is working
- [x] Integration with backend APIs is working
- [x] All buyer management components are tested
- [x] Performance is optimized for large datasets
- [x] Documentation is updated with buyer management workflows

## Success Metrics

- Users can create, edit, and manage buyer profiles efficiently
- Buyer-lead matching provides relevant suggestions
- Buyer search and filtering response time < 2 seconds
- Buyer analytics provide meaningful insights
- 90% of users can complete buyer management tasks without errors
- System can handle 500+ buyers without performance degradation

## Dependencies

- Existing backend buyer management APIs
