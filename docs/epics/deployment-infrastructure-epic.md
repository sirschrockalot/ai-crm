# Deployment Infrastructure Epic

## Epic ID
DEPLOY-001

## Epic Title
Deploy Presidential Digs CRM to Google Cloud with Infrastructure as Code and CI/CD

## Epic Description
Establish a robust, scalable deployment infrastructure for the Presidential Digs CRM application on Google Cloud Platform. This epic encompasses infrastructure as code implementation, CI/CD pipeline setup using GitHub Actions, and production-ready deployment processes that support the microservice architecture.

## Business Value
- **Reduced Deployment Risk**: Automated, repeatable deployments minimize human error
- **Faster Time to Market**: Streamlined CI/CD pipeline accelerates feature delivery
- **Scalability**: Cloud-native infrastructure supports business growth
- **Cost Optimization**: Infrastructure as code enables efficient resource management
- **Compliance**: Automated deployment processes ensure consistent security and compliance

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All services deploy successfully to Google Cloud
- [ ] Infrastructure is fully managed as code (Terraform/CloudFormation)
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline automatically deploys on code changes
- [ ] Zero-downtime deployments are achieved
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting are in place
- [ ] Disaster recovery procedures are documented and tested
- [ ] Cost monitoring and optimization are implemented

## Technical Requirements
- **Cloud Platform**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform or Google Cloud Deployment Manager
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with GCP integration
- **Container Orchestration**: Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) or Cloud Run
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (already configured)
- **Monitoring**: Google Cloud Monitoring + custom dashboards
- **Security**: IAM, VPC, Cloud Armor, Secret Manager

## Architecture Components
1. **Network Infrastructure**: VPC, subnets, firewall rules
2. **Compute Resources**: GKE clusters or Cloud Run services
3. **Storage**: Cloud Storage for static assets, logs
4. **Security**: IAM policies, service accounts, secrets management
5. **Monitoring**: Logging, metrics, alerting
6. **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions workflows, deployment automation

## Dependencies
- Authentication service implementation (AUTH-001)
- Core business services (CORE-001)
- Lead import service (LEAD-IMPORT-001)
- Frontend application (FRONTEND-001)

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Initial cloud setup complexity
- **Medium Risk**: Service discovery and load balancing configuration
- **Low Risk**: Database connectivity (MongoDB Atlas already configured)

## Timeline
- **Phase 1**: Infrastructure as Code setup (2 weeks)
- **Phase 2**: CI/CD pipeline implementation (2 weeks)
- **Phase 3**: Service deployment and testing (2 weeks)
- **Phase 4**: Monitoring and optimization (1 week)

## Stakeholders
- **Product Owner**: Joel Schrock
- **DevOps Engineer**: TBD
- **Backend Team**: Lead developers
- **Frontend Team**: Lead developers
- **QA Team**: Testing and validation
