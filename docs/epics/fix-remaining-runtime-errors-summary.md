# Fix Remaining Runtime Errors - Epic Summary

## Overview
This epic addresses the persistent runtime errors in the AI CRM application that continue to occur despite previous fixes. The focus is on implementing permanent solutions rather than temporary workarounds.

## Epic Details
- **Epic ID**: EPIC-002
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Priority**: High
- **Estimated Effort**: 8-12 story points (2-3 weeks)

## Stories Overview

### 1. [STORY-001: Resolve Persistent Port 3000 Conflicts](../stories/STORY-001-resolve-persistent-port-3000-conflicts.md)
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Story Points**: 3
- **Focus**: Fix the recurring EADDRINUSE errors on port 3000
- **Key**: Implement proper process cleanup and port management

### 2. [STORY-002: Implement Robust Port Management](../stories/STORY-002-implement-robust-port-management.md)
- **Priority**: High
- **Story Points**: 2
- **Focus**: Create a comprehensive port management system
- **Key**: Automatic port detection, fallback options, and conflict resolution

### 3. [STORY-003: Fix Environment Configuration Issues](../stories/STORY-003-fix-environment-configuration-issues.md)
- **Priority**: High
- **Story Points**: 2
- **Focus**: Resolve environment configuration problems
- **Key**: Configuration validation, proper loading, and documentation

### 4. [STORY-004: Improve Service Startup Reliability](../stories/STORY-004-improve-service-startup-reliability.md)
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Story Points**: 2
- **Focus**: Enhance overall service startup processes
- **Key**: Health checks, dependency management, and retry mechanisms

### 5. [STORY-005: Add Comprehensive Error Handling](../stories/STORY-005-add-comprehensive-error-handling.md)
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Story Points**: 1
- **Focus**: Implement better error handling throughout the application
- **Key**: Global error handling, categorization, and recovery

## Implementation Order
1. **Start with STORY-001** (Critical) - Fix the immediate port conflict issue
2. **Continue with STORY-002** (High) - Implement the port management system
3. **Address STORY-003** (High) - Fix configuration issues
4. **Implement STORY-004** (Medium) - Improve startup reliability
5. **Finish with STORY-005** (Medium) - Add comprehensive error handling

## Success Metrics
- [ ] No more EADDRINUSE errors
- [ ] Application starts consistently on first attempt
- [ ] All health checks pass
- [ ] Clear error messages and logging
- [ ] Smooth development workflow

## Current Status
- **Backend**: Running but experiencing port conflicts
- **Frontend**: Running successfully
- **Docker Services**: Running and healthy
- **Environment**: Partially configured

## Next Steps
1. Begin implementation of STORY-001
2. Investigate root causes of port conflicts
3. Implement proper process management
4. Test and validate fixes
5. Move to next story in sequence

## Notes
- Previous fixes were temporary workarounds
- Need to implement permanent architectural solutions
- Consider long-term process management strategy
- May need to review entire startup/shutdown flow
