## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] Integrates with existing backend lead management APIs
- [x] Follows existing frontend architecture patterns
- [x] Uses existing UI component library (Chakra UI)
- [x] Maintains existing routing structure
- [x] Compatible with multi-tenant architecture
- [x] Integrates with existing authentication and RBAC system

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** Poor performance with large lead datasets
**Mitigation:** Implement pagination, virtualization, and efficient data loading patterns
**Rollback Plan:** Can implement basic lead list without advanced features if needed

**Secondary Risk:** Complex lead workflow causing user confusion
**Mitigation:** User testing and iterative design improvements, clear navigation and feedback
**Rollback Plan:** Can simplify workflow to basic CRUD operations if needed

## Definition of Done

- [x] Lead CRUD operations work seamlessly
- [x] Advanced search and filtering are implemented
- [x] Lead pipeline visualization is working
- [x] Import/export functionality is complete
- [x] Integration with backend APIs is working
- [x] All lead management components are tested
- [x] Performance is optimized for large datasets
- [x] Documentation is updated with lead management workflows

## Success Metrics

- Users can create, edit, and manage leads efficiently
- Lead search and filtering response time < 2 seconds
- Lead pipeline visualization is intuitive and useful
- Import/export functionality handles common file formats
- 90% of users can complete lead management tasks without errors
- System can handle 1000+ leads without performance degradation

## Dependencies

- Existing backend lead management APIs
- Authentication and RBAC system
- Frontend design system and component library
- Existing routing and layout structure
- Communication system integration

## Estimated Effort

- **Story 1:** 4-5 days
- **Story 2:** 3-4 days  
- **Story 3:** 3-4 days
- **Total:** 10-13 days

## Status
