## What to Monitor

### 1. Agent Activity
- **Commit Frequency**: How often each agent is committing
- **Story Progress**: Which stories are completed, in progress, or not started
- **File Modifications**: Which key files have been modified
- **Integration Points**: When agents need to coordinate

### 2. Story Completion Status
- **✅ COMPLETED**: Story is fully implemented and tested
- **🔄 IN PROGRESS**: Story is currently being worked on
- **⏳ NOT STARTED**: Story has not been started yet
- **❌ BLOCKED**: Story is blocked by dependencies or issues

### 3. File Status Tracking
- **Key Files**: Monitor specific files each agent should be working on
- **Last Modified**: Track when files were last updated
- **File Creation**: Monitor when new files are created
- **File Dependencies**: Track dependencies between agents

### 4. Blocker Detection
- **Git Commit Messages**: Look for "BLOCKER", "ISSUE", "ERROR" in commits
- **Story Files**: Check for blocker markers in story documentation
- **Integration Issues**: Monitor coordination points between agents

## Agent-Specific Monitoring

### Agent 1: Lead Management Specialist
**Key Files to Monitor**:

**Stories**: 3.2, 3.3 - Analytics Migration
**Priority**: MEDIUM (Can start after Agent 1)

### Agent 3: Automation Specialist
**Key Files to Monitor**:
- `src/frontend/pages/automation/`
- `src/frontend/components/automation/`
- `src/frontend/hooks/useAutomation.ts`
- `src/frontend/hooks/useWorkflow.ts`

**Stories**: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 - Automation Migration

### Agent 4: Dashboard Specialist
**Key Files to Monitor**:
- `src/frontend/pages/dashboard.tsx`
- `src/frontend/components/dashboard/`
- `src/frontend/hooks/useDashboard.ts`
- `src/frontend/hooks/useNotifications.ts`

**Story**: 5.1 - Dashboard Migration
**Priority**: MEDIUM (Can start after Agent 1)

### Agent 5: Integration & Testing Specialist
**Key Files to Monitor**:
- `src/frontend/__tests__/`
- `src/frontend/.storybook/`
- `src/frontend/components/ui/` (consolidation)
- `src/frontend/hooks/` (optimization)

**Stories**: 6.1, 6.3 - Final Integration & Testing
**Priority**: LOW (Must wait for all other agents)

## Progress Metrics

### Story Completion
- **Total Stories**: 9
- **Target**: 100% completion by end of project
- **Current Progress**: Tracked via story file markers

### File Implementation
- **Key Files**: Monitor specific files each agent should create/modify
- **File Status**: Track existence and last modification dates
- **Dependencies**: Monitor file dependencies between agents

### Commit Activity
- **Daily Commits**: Track commit frequency per agent
- **Story-Related Commits**: Monitor commits with story IDs
- **Integration Commits**: Track commits that involve multiple agents

## Blocker Management

### Types of Blockers
1. **Technical Blockers**: API issues, dependency problems
2. **Integration Blockers**: Coordination issues between agents
3. **Resource Blockers**: Missing documentation, unclear requirements
4. **Timeline Blockers**: Schedule conflicts, priority issues

### Blocker Resolution
1. **Identify**: Use monitoring scripts to detect blockers
2. **Assess**: Determine impact and urgency
3. **Coordinate**: Bring relevant agents together
4. **Resolve**: Implement solution and update status
5. **Verify**: Confirm blocker is resolved

## Integration Checkpoints

### Weekly Checkpoints
- **Agent Status Review**: All agents report progress
- **Integration Coordination**: Address coordination points
- **Blocker Resolution**: Identify and resolve blockers
- **Timeline Assessment**: Ensure project stays on track

### Monthly Checkpoints

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Agent Not Committing**: Check if agent is blocked or needs guidance
2. **Story Not Progressing**: Review story requirements and dependencies
3. **File Not Created**: Verify agent has correct file paths and permissions
4. **Integration Conflicts**: Coordinate between agents for shared resources

### Resolution Steps
1. **Identify Issue**: Use monitoring scripts to identify problem
2. **Assess Impact**: Determine how issue affects project timeline
3. **Coordinate Response**: Bring relevant agents together
4. **Implement Solution**: Address issue and update status
