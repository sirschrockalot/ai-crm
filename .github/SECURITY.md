# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. **GitHub Security Advisories (preferred)**  
   - Go to the repository’s **Security** tab → **Advisories** → **New draft security advisory**

   - If your org provides a security contact address, report there and include “DealCycle CRM” in the subject.

### What to include

- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Steps to reproduce (proof-of-concept if available)

## Disclosure process
